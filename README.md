**Key Performance Insights**
Revenue Drivers by Occasion
Revenue is heavily influenced by seasonal occasions, with Diwali, Raksha Bandhan, and Valentine's Day being the most significant revenue generators. Sales during these periods significantly exceed the "All Occasions" baseline, indicating the critical importance of holiday-specific marketing and inventory planning.

**Monthly and Temporal Trends**
Revenue by Month shows high volatility, with notable peaks suggesting strong seasonal sales (likely coinciding with the observed occasions) and significant troughs, particularly in the mid-year (e.g., May and June show lower revenue).

The Revenue by Hour (Order Time) line chart generally shows a decreasing trend in the value of orders as the hour of the day increases, suggesting that the highest-value orders are typically placed earlier in the day.
